# Imaging through a multimode fiber cable 
## Motivation
Single-mode optical fiber cables are used universally for our day-to-day telecommunication needs. A single-mode optical fiber cable allows a single beam of  light to pass through the cable at a time this means we can only encode one pixel of image information on a beam to be transmitted through a cable at a time. This is unfortunately quite inefficient and means that getting one image from one location to another would require using large numbers of these cables. To find a more efficient approach to solving this problem a multimode fiber cable was designed and created the key difference being that it would be able to have multiple "modes" of light pass through it at once. Unfortunately, when we try to do this, pass multiple  beams of light with pixel information we observe mode and phase mixing this is when we observe the electromagnetic fields of these beams interfering and influencing each other. This results in the output image observed being a speckle pattern image .
